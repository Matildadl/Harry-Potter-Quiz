# Contributing
I asked a couple of people for their opinion for my quiz, before it was ready to save and submit. and they gave me these suggesitions for improvement.

* Text-color was to dark, I changed that to White on all buttons.
* Result-button was unnecessary before the game ended, so I changed that so it appears in the end instead.
